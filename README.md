This is a personal project for myself to gather the data of all the qualified hitters of the 2025 season as of 8/4.

The code written is about radar graphs and by substituting the the player's name in the code, I can generate their radar graph based on the 10 stats I chose to evaluate them on. 

The example I have is of Aaron Judge and I have created a dashboard on Tableau for him as well to better illustrate the visual (in Dashboard folder).
